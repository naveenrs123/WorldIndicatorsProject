# world-indicators-project

This is a small personal project involving an analysis of two indicators found in the World Bank's World Indicators Data Set, available on Kaggle.com. This project utilises Python, specifically the NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Folium libraries, to compare and analyze Arable Land (% of Total Land Area) and Urban Population (% of Total).

The Data Set can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators

You only require Indicators.csv for the project to run. Edit the file path of the read_csv function to make sure that the Notebook runs properly.
